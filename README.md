# Busy GitHub
Let's be honest -- There are a lot of projects I work on that I'd rather not have be public and I'm too cheap to upgrade my GitHub plan. I usually work on them via [BitBucket] (http://bitbucket.com). But I don't want it to look like I've gone quiet right? Thus **Busy Github**. Now I'm aware there are services out there that one can sign up for for free or pay for that make it look like I'm keeping busy but I think that's dishonest. So instead I've created this repository as a journal of sorts that I'll update frequently to reflect what I'm working on so that you know I keep coding! Other than journal entries, I'll also put links to other tutorial lessons I work.
